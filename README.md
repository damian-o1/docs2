# Mina Docs

This Mina Docs website is [docs.minaprotocol.com](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/).

## To contribute content

Thank you for your interest! See the docs [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

## How to see your doc updates during development

The docs output is generated by a CI pipeline which means that we can update the docs site whenever we want, so the [Mina Docs](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/) website always contains the most up-to-date content available. 

During the documentation build process, each PR goes through Vercel CI to test the doc updates and build a preview of your changes. Vercel for GitHub automatically deploys and provides preview deployment URLs. After the PR status is ready, click **Visit Preview** and navigate to the changed page to see your doc updates.

Sometimes it is helpful to see local updates before you push changes to GitHub. To run a local build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How to run in production

On the host:

- Set environment variables: `ALGOLIA_APP_ID` and `ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY` to appropriate values
- Set build command: `npm run build`
- Set output directory: `build`
- Set install command: `npm ci`
